### ABOUT ME
If you asked me 20 years ago if I would be finishing my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and authoring my own webpage, I would have thought you were nuts! 
Of course, I also lived in a different state, was single, and worked 80 hours per week too! Times have certainly changed. Virtually all my knowledge before I went 
back to school was from that other school, the one of hard knocks. I learned, screwed up, persevered, and did what I could to make a difference. At this point in 
my life, I'm a Controls Engineer, and I'm fine with that. I'd love to run a team again, maybe someday an entire department. If it controls something, I can code it. 
I can also build it, wire it, start it up and debug it too. I'm the whole package (yes, I am tooting my own horn).

To show you what I can do, look through my site, check out some code, let me know what you think!

## Code Review
Let's kick things off with a code review. This is of a module I authored and had several iterations over the years (spoiler alert, I enhanced it below):

## Enhanced Chiller Module
Can't have a code review complete with enhancement suggestions without actually showing them off, can you? Well, here is a link to show them off!
