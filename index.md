### WELCOME! I'M GLAD YOU ARE HERE!
I'm excited to showcase to you what I can do, what I have done, and I'm certainly excited to get your unbiased opinion! To show you what I can do, take a look around 
the site, check out some of my accomplishments, and let me know what you think!


## SELF-ASSESSMENT
If you asked me 20 years ago if I would be finishing my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and authoring my own webpage, I would have thought you were nuts! 
Of course, I also lived in a different state, was single, and worked 80 hours per week too! Times have certainly changed. Virtually all my knowledge before I went 
back to school was from that other school, the one of hard knocks. I learned, screwed up, persevered, and did what I could to make a difference. At this point in 
my life, I'm a Controls Engineer, and I'm fine with that. I'd love to run a team again, maybe someday an entire department. If it controls something, I can code it. 
I can also build it, wire it, start it up and debug it too. I'm the whole package (yes, I am tooting my own horn).

So, why did I embark on the degree journey? Portability, for one. I was happy at my current job, and they did not require me to get any additional education, but
I would also be stuck there. Things were changing there, and for me personally too. My wife was just finishing her schooling for an advanced degree, and it seemed
like a good time to do it. Probably the biggest thing I learned throughout my adademic journey is there is no magic bullet. There was no "Aha" moment for me. I knew
a lot of what was being taught already from my employment. Some things I had no idea about, and may never use them again (Calculus, how I struggled with thee!). Some
things were really fun, and I actually wished the class had more I needed to do (Raspberry Pi projects are in my future!). The biggest thing I learned was about me.
I could do it. I could do it # well. 

I laugh when I think of how this journey has showcased my strengths. In more than one class, I ended up being the main point of contact from my classmates for help.
I'm sure they emailed the instructor too, but it became commonplace for me to start checking my email every day for something from my classmates. They came to me 
not because I am the best student, the know-it-all (at least I hope not). They came to me because I have a quality that cannot be taught: Humble Assistance. What
in the world is that? Well, to me, I love to share when I learn something. I bore my family with it. My colleagues stare at me like I have three heads. But I never
keep it to myself. If I find a workaround or a fix to a big problem, say something that people have been struggling with and it's making life miserable, I share it. 
I don't hide it, proclaim to be the expert. I share it for all to utilize. That's who I am. Moreover, I have learned I have a passion for running a team. Nothing gives
me more pride than letting a team shine, bragging about them, and most of all, allowing them to do their job. That's what I believe a true leader to be. Someone that
empowers a team, and then just gets out of their way, removing anything in their way and letting them shine. I don't need the spotlight; it will find them if I only 
let them do their job. I can't explain team dynamics any better than that. The old adage "there's no I in team" rings true with me. 

What good is a team if you don't have anyone to play? That seems weird in software development, but it is true. You need customers. Many times your customers are
internal to the organization; people that assemble machines. People who use your software to create other software. The list is endless. Communication is absolutely key.
If you do not listen to your customer, you are already doomed to fail. However, customers are not your only stakeholder (although, arguably, they are the most
important ones!). If you promise something, but take 3 times longer, 8 times the manpower and 4 times the resources, the company is not going to survive. Management
communication is key, but here is where I differ a bit from the norm. To me, as a leader, I absorb this. I sit with my team and develop a plan. Then I go and fight for
them. It's not their job to sit in endless meetings, discuss budgets and requirements; it's their job to get the job done, and I try to make that happen!

I've rambled on about my personal beliefs and business, which I feel are important to a self-assessment, but how do they tie in with a degree at SNHU? Very well, it
turns out. My simplistic approach to design has made both friends and enemies. Some people just don't like simple, and they defend endlessly complicated and difficult
functionality. Data structures should be extremely well organized, easy to understand, and bullet proof. How? A structure should be named uniquely and distinctly, so 
there is no confusion about what it is. Something like "myStruct.var1" is ambiguous. What is it? What does it do? Instead, maybe for some inputs and outputs on a
machine, we have "IO.inputs.DI_limitSwitchNeg." We know the structure pertains to inputs and outputs, and the second structure is just inputs. It could be analog or
digital, but we put digital in the name. Then the name tells us exactly what it does. If there are multiple limit switches, we go further and describe what the limit
switch is doing. Seems simple and straight forward, right? But so many in this industry don't do it that way. I'm working to change that.

I let the algorighms speak for themselves. Check out my chiller module below. I can't describe or explain it any better than I did there. This is a perfect example
of utilizing an algorithm to solve a problem, even if I do say so myself.

Databases are a challenge for me. I've done a lot of work with poorly designed databases, but I didn't want to put that in here. That makes no sense. "Hey, look what I 
with this terrible database!" Your first question would be, "Why did you use that?" So I didn't. Instead I took something that I used at SNHU and polished it. I think
it is a pretty nice artifact representing databases, and showcases how I approach a problem. This was for a class that interestingly had object oriented roots. BUT, the
concept works, and it shows how I think. Break down a problem into smaller sections, Refine and iterate until you have workable modules. Then code the modules, integrate
them, and test. A big project becomes small tasks, and before you know it, you have a workable solution.

In regards to security, I'm old school. Really old school. I'm not going to try and block you from getting in with encryption or obfuscation, I'm just not going to let you
at all! The absolute best security you can have is no access. You can't defeat that. If there is no connection, there is nothing to hack. However, in the real world, that
is not feasible. I know that. So the solution is a hybrid. Lock out as much as you can, and where we do have to allow access, we make it very narrow and highly secure. If
there is only one point of entry, there is only one thing protect. On the flip side, that one thing better be rock solid, because that is where all the effort is going to
be spent.

So that's it; that's how I assess myself. For more ramblings about me, see the next section. I started this as my self-assessment, but thought it better in an about me
page. The artifacts I have chosen fit me as a developer, showcase what my talents are, and most importantly, reflect on my time at SNHU garnering this degree.

## ABOUT ME
It seems a little strange when I just rambled on about my self-assessment to then have an about me page, buthow else can I explain what I feel my strengths and 
weaknesses are? There is not a programmer on the planet who is an expert in everything they do. That's OK! I am by no means an expert, but I am pretty darn good 
at my craft, if I do say so myself. [About Me](https://laswiz.github.io/turbo-bassoon/AboutMe.html)

## CODE REVIEW
Let's kick things off with a code review. This is of a module I authored and had several iterations over the years (spoiler alert, I enhanced it below):

## ENHANCED CHILLER MODULE
Can't have a code review complete with enhancement suggestions without actually showing them off, can you? Well, here is a link to show them off!

## FILE HANDLING
I like simple. I've stated that. Repeatedly. So when I started a new job and the first complaint I got was that file handling has always been a problem, I wanted to
fix it! Turns out, the PLC controlled all the file handling on a Windows platform. That is a recipe for disaster. Why not let Windows handle the files? After all, it
is what it is best at. Let Windows manage network devices, share names, portable devices. The PLC shouldn't care. However, we do need an interface to this... How about
Powershell? A light, portable interface that uses standard Windows Forms. So I did it. Here are the results.
