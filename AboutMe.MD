### How do I Assess Thee?
Where do I start? I touched on it on the home page a bit. I never expected to end up here. I've always been a friend of technology. From a young age, I just "got" computers. 
I built my first one when I was a teenager. I loved playing video games, but was always fascinated about how they worked more than playing them (but I did do both!). 
When I started working, I ended up being the whiz kid who could diagnose the new computer enabled cars. The old timers hated me (well, they hated the technology... I was
just the guy who could understand it). I saw an opportunity to go to a technical college and get into the work force with a high paying job way before my friends would
finish college, so I took it. Things snowballed from there.

### In the Beginning
I took several career aptitude tests. The verdict? I should be a technical writer. I hated writing! No way I was doing that. I had a connection to possibly get into the
Air Force Academy; but because I had had surgery on my knee and had documented back problems, I'd never fly an airplane. Why would I go then? Thinking back now, it was a
dumb kid moment, I should have taken it. But life turned out ok. My father steered me towards lasers. To a kid that grew up at the height of the cold war, lasers sounded
pretty cool. I went for it. At this point, I worked full time and went to school full time... there wasn't much time for fun things like computers and programming. But
I did build my second computer when in college, and even splurged on a 100MB hard drive. I think it was $200 at the time for that! 

### Off We Go
I was approached by a recruiter in my last term in college. She had a company looking for laser service technicians, and wanted one based in Minnesota, where I lived.
They were in Connecticut; a company I had never heard of before. I had a good phone call with them, and the next day, I received an airplane ticket to fly out for an
interview. To a 21 year old kid, this was huge. I started January 2nd, which happened to be a holiday, so I got paid before even working one day for the company. I
flew out there, and spent the first 3 months training. Then it was just me and my toolbox, traveling around installing and fixing industrial laser machines. The smallest
laser they made was 700 watts, which incidentally, was 100 watts higher than the highest power laser I worked on in college. I learned I had a knack for these machines,
and I also got the reputation that I was a good person to work with problematic customers. Why? Because I listened! The very first thing I would ask when I arrived was
what the operator felt was wrong. After all, they knew the machine better than anybody, and that knowledge was invaluable. Many times the upper management didn't like this,
asking why I was wasting time. But (nearly) every time I was able to fix it, and that usually quelled the chatter from them. The company released a new machine with
Windows as an operating system (the previous ones were an embedded operating system that was specific to the control, no other software ran. It was an embedded OS). I was
sent to Germany to learn about it because 2 of the first 3 systems were being installed in my area. I learned a lot about them, and started asking questions that even the
developers couldn't answer. It got to the point where they didn't want to deal with me anymore. However, we soon learned that the questions I was asking were going to be
very important to the development of the machine. Things like networking, software updates, diagnosis, these things were not thought of at first, but they were certainly
important! I got to know the developers in Germany pretty well, and it would pay off for me very soon.

### Cream of the Crop
I got to be so good at this new control I ended up doing the majority of software updates, training new engineers, and the advanced installs. My cell phone rang constantly
other engineers when they had problems. Eventually, this fractured into another group, a specialty group that did automation, advanced installations, and rescues of engineers
that couldn't figure out the issue with. Numerous times I was pulled from a job to rescue other engineers, which brings me to one of my biggest strengths: Step Back and take
stock. I was pulled on a Thursday to rescue another engineer that was having problems with a big system. I had never seen this system before, but they sent me anyways to
support him (this was a customer that didn't like BS. Talk to him straight and he was your friend. You didn't have to know the answer, just don't lie to him. THAT would
garner a phone call to the head of development for the parent company!). I arrived to seeing the electrical cabinet, the machine control and the remote post completely
torn apart, wires hanging, and manual upon manual strewn about. "What's the matter?" I asked. The service guy told me they couldn't get the robotic arm to move to the third
position. "It's missing the button" he said. I looked at the post. I noticed the labels had 1,2 and 3 on them. Both were lit up, which to me meant it was in position 2. 
I pushed the button that pointed to position 3. The arm moved. "Hey Andrew, is this what you wanted?" I asked. "How did you do that?" he asked. "I pushed the button!" 
The customer, who had walked me out to the machine when I arrived, stood there with his mouth open. That is my take on things. What is expected? What do you want? Is
this the best possible way to do things? The easiest? This is my methodology, and it has followed me into development. Some people write elegant code. Mine is simple,
and I'm proud of it. It might seem simplistic, but writing easy to use code is very difficult.

### Bigger and Better Things
I got sick of the road. The money was great, but only being home for 48 hours stunk. I didn't have a life. My boss offered me a transfer to phone support. I took it. In
August 2001, I moved to Connecticut. One thing I learned about phone support. You can't do the same thing as when you are at the customer. Asking what is wrong does not
go over well when doing phone support. By this time, they have already talked to two other people, and don't want to explain it again. I was never cut out for phone 
support; I just got too frustrated not being able to just fix it myself. After a year, I was approached by the Software Engineering Manager. He asked if I wanted to develop
software. I told him I had no experience. No matter he said. "I can teach you the software, but you have what few others have; you know the machine." I mentored under
a senior developer. I learned C. I learned VB. I started writing machine control code. Then I was given projects. Then I was a lead developer. Then I was promoted to
the group leader. I ended up managing my former mentor (but there were no hard feelings, he was perfectly fine just being a developer). I had now risen to nearly the top
of the pyramid in my little world, and all I had was grit, determination and experience. I needed that degree to go with it.

### Whaddaya Mean There's No Magic Beans?
I expected to learn a LOT when I started my academic career. I some ways, I have. I've been able to put together why things work and how best to utilize them because
of my academic career at SNHU. But I was naive. I never expected to learn that there was nothing specific to learn in college! Wait, what was that? College is there
to teach you how to do something, but they don't know how you will use it, they can only teach you how to learn it. YOU have to actually apply it. It turns out that I 
already had all the tools I needed; but I needed to organize them, categorize them, and learn how to use them. That's what I have done at SNHU.

### Movin' On
I have left that company that gave me so much. It was hard. I worked there for over 22 years. But I needed a change. Part of this assessment is looking inward on yourself.
How have I changed over my academic career? When I started, it was to make life better for me. To find an opportunity to get a better job. In the midst of it, I did.
Now I'm looking again. After my academic career is finished, I want to move on to that next rung. I've developed a lot over the years, and the next rung is management for 
me. I've been there, I hated it, but now that it is gone, I miss it! I miss running a team. I miss bragging about my team, showing off what they can do; getting out of 
their way and letting them do it.

### Assess This
For my capstone, I had to do a self-assessment. I went back much farther than my academic career, but I felt it important. Why? Because from that first company I worked
for, I've been working towards this. Without my personal drive, I never would have ended up at the top of the heap. Without managers who believed in me, I would have 
never gotten a chance to develop software. To be honest, most of the work at SNHU was easy for me. Not because the work was easy. Because I've already had to learn it!
That school of hard knocks gives much worse grades than any instructor, and the feedback much more direct. There is no curve here, it's a cliff. Sink or swim, the choice
is yours. I chose to swim.
